Spglib is a library for finding and handling crystal symmetries
written in C. There are the {ref}`python <python_spglib>`,
{ref}`fortran, rust, and ruby <interfaces>` interfaces.
Version history is found at [ChangeLog](https://github.com/spglib/spglib/blob/master/ChangeLog).

The detailed algorithm of spglib is described the following text:

* "{math}`\texttt{Spglib}`: a software library for crystal symmetry search",
  Atsushi Togo and Isao Tanaka,
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01590> (written at version 1.10.4)

%    * SpglibDataset is slightly modified at version 1.9.4. This may hit
%      some users.
%
%    * Python module pyspglib is renamed to spglib in version 1.9.0.
%
%      In versions 1.8.x or before, the python wrapper (pyspglib) was
%      considered as a special extension of spglib and separately maintained,
%      but in version 1.9.x and later, it starts to be a part of spglib as a
%      usual extension, and this python wrapper will be maintained to work
%      following every update of c-spglib. The package name is changed from
%      pyspglib to spglib. Following this change, the way to import python
%      spglib module is changed and it is written in :ref:`python_spglib`.
